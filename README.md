# UFOs
## Overview
This project builds a dynamic webpage that helps Dana share her UFO's sighting information research. This webpage has an interactive search function to display a concise dashboard of sighting results based on an HTML file.

**Tools:**

Bootstraps, JavaScripts, HTML, Google DevTool

## Results:
At first glance on the page, we see a navigator bar named "UFO Sightings" on the top left corner,  an undeveloped button for users to go to the main page.

Second, scroll the mouse down. The primary purpose is shown on the central middle with an attractive galaxy background.

In the third part, Dana gives us an article about UFO sightings and encourages users to figure out more results on this website.

The last section is the core of the webpage, which filters the UFO sighting data correctly based on user input and displays an organized table. Users can filter the data based on city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary:
The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage 
 UFO sighting data is only limited in the United States, so users cannot grasp much more information throughout the world. 
The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development.
Improve the navigator to the search sections directly to save the users time.
Add more functions at the bottom, such as "contact us." This function may group more people interested in UFO sightings to communicate and contribute to the webpage.
